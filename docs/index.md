## Overview

The ITK Distributed Registration module (`itk-dreg`) provides a framework based on the
Insight Toolkit (ITK) and the `dask.distributed` library for the purpose of registering
large-scale images out of memory.

Traditional image registration techniques in ITK and other libraries (Elastix, ANTs) require
in-memory processing, meaning those techniques load images fully in memory (RAM) during
registration execution. Meanwhile, large image datasets can occupy terabytes of data for a single
image on the cloud and far exceed available memory. `itk-dreg` addresses this issue as a
map-reduce problem where images are successivly subdivided into subimages, registered,
and then composed into a descriptive output. Multiple `itk-dreg` registration graphs may be
executed in succession to yield a pipeline for multiresolution image registration.

`itk-dreg` provides three major components:
- Concepts to describe the map-reduce registration problem;
- A user-ready registration method to produce `itk.DisplacementFieldTransform`s from out-of-memory
    registration with Dask scheduling and ITKElastix registration;
- A developer framework to extend `itk-dreg` with novel registration and reduction methods.
